# **Philippine Grants Intelligence Service**  
### **Non-Technical Guide for Relationship Builders**  

## **What We Do (In Simple Terms)**  
We help organizations **find, track, and win** government funding (grants & contracts) in the Philippines by:  
✅ **Cutting through the noise** – We filter thousands of government opportunities to show only the **most relevant** ones for our clients.  
✅ **Spotting hidden patterns** – We analyze past awards to predict **future opportunities** and **success rates**.  
✅ **Saving time & stress** – Instead of clients digging through complex government websites, we deliver **clear, actionable alerts**.

## **Who Needs This? (Our Clients)**  
We serve:  
1. **Local Businesses (SMEs)** – Especially those bidding on government contracts (e.g., suppliers, construction firms).  
2. **NGOs & Non-Profits** – Looking for grants from agencies like DOST, DOH, or DSWD.  
3. **Provincial/LGU Offices** – Tracking national government funding for local projects.  
4. **Universities & Researchers** – Applying for DOST or CHED research grants.  

**Key Pain Points We Solve:**  
❌ *"We miss deadlines because we don’t know where to look."*  
❌ *"We waste time on bids we’ll never win."*  
❌ *"We don’t know who’s winning similar projects."*

- Our system flags **matching opportunities** and **predicts success chances** based on history.  

### **3. We Deliver Insights**  
- **Weekly Email Alerts** – "Here are 5 new grants you qualify for."

## **Your Role as Relationship Builder**  
### **What You’ll Do:**  
1. **Talk to Clients**  
   - Understand their needs (e.g., *"We’re a small NGO focused on education"*).  
   - Explain how our service saves them time/money.  

2. **Show Value (Without Tech Talk)**  
   - *"Last month, we helped a client like you discover 3 grants they missed."*  
   - *"Our data shows DOST releases most science grants in Q3—let’s prepare early."*  

3. **Gather Feedback**  
   - *"Was this week’s report helpful? What else do you need?"*  
   - Share client requests with the tech team (e.g., *"Can we track DTI grants too?"*).  

### **How to Explain It to Clients**  
❌ **Don’t say:** *"We use DuckDB to normalize XML data."*  
✅ **Do say:**  
- *"We monitor all government websites so you don’t have to."*  
- *"We analyze past awards to show you the best opportunities."*  
- *"You’ll get a simple report every week—no more guesswork."*
