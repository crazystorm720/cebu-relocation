Hello Mr. Davis this is Mr. Rego at Hamilton MS. I work with Noah in math class and he has shown that he is very bright and capable. He does however have trouble following the expectations of the class like using his computer at the appropriate time, staying in his seat, and talking to other students. I want to make sure he gets off to a good start at Hamilton and ask that you talk to him about getting back on track. Thank you for the support.

Thank you for the message. I'd like to get an update from your perspective in a couple of weeks.  Noah is under pressure to improve and align from me, he just recently moved back in with me after a failed attempt to make things work in Texas with his mom.
I'm getting him back on his adhd meds, this should help him focus and calm the situation. I look forward to any and all feedback. 
I really appreciate the update and support. I can give you an update in a few weeks on his progress. He is definitely smart and capable, I am looking forward to him applying himself in class and doing well. He can be a great leader.  Thank you.
The problem with Noah is motivation when it comes to school. He has zero interest in school, unfortunately.  I have him active in Python programming, cloud technologies, and networking - luckily, he finds this interesting.  He likes chess and recently built an AI that simulates chess games and branched out to using C++.  I recognize that the world needs less smart people who are jerks, so his behavior is my top priority for me 😄
That's impressive work! It's good to hear that he is finding things that he enjoys! That info helps us to try to relate some of the work to his interests.

Thank you for taking time to speak with Melodi this afternoon about Noah.  We're working very hard to get Noah on the right track here at home.  I am very interested in getting him talking to people like yourself and tap into resources you have at your disposal.  I also want to make sure we have Melodi properly set up within the DPS system so she can be empowered to help me here.  Any help and guidance here is greatly appricated!  😀
Thank you in advance Rebecca!

Hi there Mrs Tulk - thank you for the message. Your feedback is appreciated. We're actively working on going from pretty good to a solid good so you'll have to give me an update in a few weeks. 😀
I like that! I will keep you posted! :) Appreciate you responding so quickly.
Unfortunately the incremental improvement will be a long road but we'll get there.  I don't have to tell you how 13/14 year olds can be. lol

Hi Jason, it's Mrs. Tulk, Noah's Social Studies teacher. We have reached solid status today! Noah did awesome in class. He was so focused and did a great job on his assignment. Just wanted to let you know. Have a good day!
Thank you for your feedback. Noah certainly needs some extra credit these days. 
No problem!

Good morning, I'm sorry I thought this sent yesterday but it did not. Noah threw a book at another student yesterday in period 2. He will serve reflective lunch tomorrow (Thursday). He also brought in a cereal bar to period 2 today, I reminded him food is not allowed in class. Thanks so much, Ms. T

Hello, just wanted to follow up with the voicemail I sent. When we were walking back from the library during period 9 today Noah was playing leapfrog with another student and fell pretty hard. He then laughed about it, and asked me to print his missing assignments because he forgot his Chromebook.
Thank you for the message.  I'm working with him on getting caught up, I appricate the update.

Good afternoon,  Jason. This is Ms. Manzanares, an assistant principal at Hamilton Middle School. I noticed that Noah has missed school the past week, and I need to speak to him concerning an issue at school involving another student. He may information that is very important to an investigation I am conducting about google searches by our students. Is it possible to speak to him at some point today? If so, may I call him at 3:30 this afternoon?
Hello Ms. Manzanares, would you mind sharing some additional context about Noah's involvement in this situation?
Absolutely. It was reported to me that Noah had a conversation with a classmate last Monday, May 13, about topics you cannot search on the internet. I'm wanting to talk to him to corroborate information his classmate shared about this topic and the time of day it occurred.
Ok thank you, I'm passing this along to his mom.  Noah moved back with her over the weekend.  I'll let you know once I hear back from her on Noah's availability.
