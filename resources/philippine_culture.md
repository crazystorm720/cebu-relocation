Yes, this is a complex but very real social dynamic in the Philippines. Let me break this down:

1. Historical Context
- English became entrenched during American colonial period (1898-1946)
- Initially, only elite families had access to American education
- Post-independence, English remained the language of government, business, and higher education
- Private schools (typically for wealthy families) emphasize English more than public schools

2. Modern Manifestations
- "Conyo" English (mixed English-Tagalog with American accent) often indicates upper class background
- Job opportunities, especially high-paying ones, often require strong English skills
- International schools, which are very expensive, teach primarily in English
- Many elite private schools fine students for speaking Filipino on campus
- Business meetings among executives are typically conducted in English
- Social media posts in fluent English often signal educational/class status

3. Career Impact
- Higher-paying BPO/call center jobs require neutral English accents
- Executive positions typically require excellent English
- International companies prefer strong English speakers
- Better English often means better client-facing opportunities
- Academic advancement often requires strong English

4. Social Indicators
- "Native" English speakers (those who speak it at home) are usually upper class
- Heavy Filipino accents can be stigmatized in certain circles
- Code-switching (mixing English and Filipino) varies by class:
  - Upper class: More English, less Filipino
  - Middle class: Mixed, but conscious effort to use English
  - Lower class: More Filipino, limited English

5. Educational Connection
- Top universities conduct classes primarily in English
- English proficiency tests (IELTS/TOEFL) are expensive
- Private English tutoring is a marker of privilege
- Study abroad programs (requiring English) are for wealthy families

6. Media and Entertainment
- English language media consumption indicates education level
- English language books are more expensive than Filipino ones
- Hollywood movies without subtitles are watched by English speakers
- Local TV channels have English and Filipino programming targeting different social classes

7. Generational Aspects
- Younger generations generally have better English due to:
  - Internet exposure
  - Global media
  - International education opportunities
- Older wealthy families often speak better English due to historical access to education

8. Regional Variations
- Metro Manila has highest concentration of English speakers
- Provincial areas may use more local languages
- But wealthy provincial families still often speak excellent English
- Cities with large BPO sectors (Cebu, Davao) have increasing English use

9. Cultural Tensions
- Some view English prominence as colonial mentality
- Others see it as necessary for global competitiveness
- Debates about language of instruction in schools
- Movement to preserve and promote Filipino languages
- Push against English as marker of intelligence

10. Professional Settings
- Email communication typically in English
- Presentations usually in English
- Better English often leads to faster promotion
- Customer service roles require English fluency
- International client interaction needs strong English

11. Social Media Impact
- English posts often get more engagement
- Grammar policing is common
- "Sophisticated" content often in English
- Local language content sometimes seen as less prestigious

12. Dating/Marriage
- English proficiency can affect marriage prospects
- International dating often requires English skills
- Some families prefer English-speaking partners
- Social events in upper circles conducted in English

This language-class correlation creates several challenges:
- Reinforces social inequality
- Limits social mobility
- Creates linguistic insecurity
- Affects self-esteem and confidence
- Can cause cultural identity conflicts
- May limit access to opportunities
- Creates pressure to prioritize English over native languages

Despite these issues, the reality is that English proficiency remains a powerful social and economic marker in Philippine society, often opening doors to better opportunities and higher social circles. This situation doesn't seem likely to change soon, given English's global dominance in business and technology.
