Method:

1. Preparation (30 mins before cooking):
   - Remove pork from refrigerator
   - Mix marinade ingredients
   - Marinate pork for 30 minutes at room temperature
   - Pat meat completely dry before cooking

2. Initial Sear:
   - Heat dutch oven over medium-high heat until very hot
   - Add oil in batches, sear meat 3-4 minutes per side
   - Remove and set aside meat
   - Target: Deep brown crust

3. Aromatics:
   - Reduce heat to medium
   - In the same pot, sauté onions (5 mins)
   - Add garlic (2 mins)
   - Add bay leaves

4. Building the Braise:
   - Add tomato sauce, scrape bottom of pot
   - Simmer 5 minutes until slightly darkened
   - Return meat to pot
   - Add chicken stock
   - Bring to simmer, reduce heat to low
   - Cover and simmer 1 hour

5. Vegetable Stage (in order):
   - Add carrots, cook 15 mins
   - Add potatoes, cook 10 mins
   - Add bell peppers, cook 5 mins
   - Add peas, cook 3 mins

6. Final Flavor Building:
   - Stir in liver spread until well incorporated
   - Add cheese, stir until melted
   - Season with fish sauce
   - Add Thai chilies if using
   - Simmer uncovered 10-15 mins to thicken

7. Finishing:
   - Check seasoning
   - Let rest 15-20 minutes before serving
   - Sauce should coat back of spoon

Temperature Checks:
- Oil for searing: Should shimmer (350-400°F)
- Braising: Gentle simmer (180-190°F)
- Final meat temp: 195°F

Serving:
- Serve hot with steamed white rice
- Garnish with extra cheese if desired
- Best served fresh, but flavors develop well overnight

Notes:
- Don't rush the searing process
- Keep braise at gentle simmer
- Stir occasionally to prevent sticking
- If sauce is too thick, add hot stock
- If too thin, simmer uncovered longer

Storage:
- Keeps refrigerated for 3-4 days
- Flavors often improve next day
- Reheat gently to prevent meat from toughening
